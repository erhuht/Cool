# Cool
This is just a collection of weird zero-effort (okay maybe some effort) console visualizations and other things. They are all *very funnily* named ``CoolX.py``.

## Things to note
### Common variables:
- ``WIDTH`` is the width of the console i.e. How many characters fit on one line.
- ``HEIGHT`` is the height of the console.

## ``Cool.py``
This is the original ``Cool.py``. It began on a finnish lesson video call during the COVID-19 outbreak. It shows a sine wave with a rising frequency.

## ``Cool2.py``
This one is what I was actually going for with the first one. It's basically a pendulum wave illusion.

## ``Cool3.py``
``Cool3.py`` is basically just a mandelbrot set visualization. The math parts are ripped off the internet. The only thing I did was make it convert it to ASCII.

## ``Cool4.py``
This has very little to do with the other ones. I just thought it would be cool (pun intended) to see a generated terrain go by in the console. 

## ``Cool5.py``
A really twitchy (probably just because the resolution is so low) [boids algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids). The code is bad and I'm still not sure whether it works or just happens to look like it's working.

## ``Cool6.py``
A work-in-progress n-body simulation.
